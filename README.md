# Feedback for Quantitative Methods

As we discussed in class, this assignment counts as a normal assignment, but requires no
coding! It does require some "analysis" in a general sense, though, since I'm asking you
to give me detailed feedback to help improve Quantitative Methods. I'd expect this to 
take about an hour. 

For your Feedback, write in whatever application you prefer: Word, Markdown, R-Markdown, etc. If
you work in something like Google Docs then output your results to an actual file (not a link)
that I have a durable copy. 

This is the first time this course has ever been taught but the plan is for it to continue
into the future. It'll likely become a required class in the MSBA soon and I'm going to try
to bring in students from other areas of campus. Up next: Forestry. 

Generally speaking I like this overall plan:

1. Resampling Statistics: This seems like a good way to review your earlier
stats class, get practice programming, and learn about these cool techniques.
2. Regression: Just spending time fitting models and interpreting them. This
year we mostly did fake data stuff during this time.
3. Tidymodels: Lots of time talking about the Tidymodels set of packages
and learning what we can do with them. 

Here's some guidance for what I'd like you to think about in your feedback:

## 1. Overall Impressions
Would you recommend this course to future MSBA students? How come? 
What parts of the course were most valuable for you? Which parts were least valuable?  

What did you think about those three big modules listed above? Where would you have liked more time? Where
would you have liked less time? 

## 2. Readings

The readings this year were a mess! We started with _Data Analysis for the Life Sciences_, which
was fine but not great in my opinion. I recommended _Regression and Other Stories_, which I love, but 
without it being required it was hard to lean on too heavily. We spent a lot of time at the end
of the course reading _Tidymodels with R_. I thought this book was pretty good and would use it again.

We also read _Naked Statistics_. I'm not sure I'd use this book again.

Go through the readings on Moodle and let me know what you thought of the various readings. Did any 
of the short readings stand out as being either good or bad? What books would you keep? What gaps 
need filling? How much reading is reasonable? How much did you actually do? Did the amount you did
seem to hurt or help in particular ways? 

## 3. Class sessions

We did a lot of different stuff in class. With the 2 hour session I got away from the in-class work
a bit since it ate a lot of time. Since synchronous attendance isn't required, I found it slightly
tricky to figure out what activities made the most sense with the time we had in class. I typically
lectured for at least 45 minutes, sometimes much longer. (I had wanted to record the lectures, but 
typically I was finishing them within 24 hours of the class session. Recording could be an option next
year.)

Here's an opportunity to give me feedback on the class sessions. Maybe do recorded classes and then
discussion/work in class? What stood out to you as effective? What stood out as ineffective? 

## 4. Assignments

The assignments made up a lot of class. I know Burrowing Bees was a lot of work. Should that maybe count
for 2? Or maybe I just help more? I also know the "Bootstrap Chi and Correlation" one was way too long. I'm 
going to split that into two. 

What else do you have for me? Any assignments really good? Any pretty bad? How's the level of difficulty?

We did a bunch of work with the fake data. I know that got boring, but it seemed to me to give us a chance
to work with *just* a handful of concepts and not let the data "get in the way". On the other hand, there 
aren't things like solutions. I really _did_ like the creativity of the data sets and so I don't want to lose
that entirely. Let me know if you have ideas for improvement. 

I think next year I'm going to say first drafts have to be in within a week. Thoughts? 

## 5. Contracts

Is the level of effort for the various contract grades about right? What did you think of only having
assignments on the contracts? What could improve that experience? 

## 6. Technology

We basically did Moodle and GitHub Classroom. It seems reasonably smooth from my side. How'd it work 
out for you, particularly for people who hadn't used it before? Anything I can do to make that easier?

## 7. Final Thoughts

This is a section to give me some closing thoughts or feedback that doesn't fit into
the other sections. 



Thanks for being a guinea pig and taking this course. It was fun having you in class and I certainly
learned as much from you all as you learned from me. Major 'preesh, as a friend of mine likes to say.
